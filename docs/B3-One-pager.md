# B3 (Brick by Brick)

**Build Yourself. Brick by Brick.**

## What It Is

B3 is a mobile fitness app that helps users build lasting habits through small, consistent actions. Every workout—whether 3 minutes or 30—becomes a "brick" in your visual foundation. At the heart of B3 is **BRIX**, an AI coach that learns your patterns and adapts its tone to keep you moving forward.

## The Problem

90% of fitness app users quit within 60 days. Apps focus on features—workout libraries, calorie counters, streak trackers—but ignore the real issue: **motivation fluctuates, life happens, and one-size-fits-all plans don't work.**

## The Solution

B3 transforms adherence through three core innovations:

**1. Adaptive Behavioral Coaching**  
BRIX observes your patterns (workout times, energy levels, consistency) and automatically adjusts its tone—supportive during low motivation, challenging during streaks, gentle after breaks.

**2. Momentum-Based Progression**  
Every workout is a "brick." Missing a day isn't failure—it's just a gap in your wall that BRIX helps you fill. This reframes fitness from perfectionism to construction work: some days you lay more bricks, some days fewer, but the foundation keeps growing.

**3. Context-Aware Recommendations**  
Low energy? BRIX suggests a 5-minute win instead of your usual 20-minute session. Returning after travel? It shifts to rebuild mode with gentler workouts. The app understands that life happens.

## User Experience

BRIX feels like a personal coach who genuinely knows you. It remembers milestones ("5th time completing this routine—consistency matters"), recognizes patterns ("You work out best in the mornings—want a 7 AM reminder?"), and celebrates wins ("Seven days straight! Your foundation is getting stronger").

The visual brick wall provides tangible evidence of progress, transforming abstract fitness goals into concrete construction work.

## Target Users

- Frequent restarters who struggle with long-term consistency
- Beginners seeking guidance without overwhelming intensity
- Anyone juggling work, family, and stress who needs fitness to adapt to real life

## MVP Features

- BRIX-guided onboarding with personalized welcome
- Visual 30-day brick wall showing completed and missed workouts
- Adaptive coaching tone (supportive, challenging, gentle, energizing)
- Starter workout library (15-20 workouts, 5-30 minutes)
- Daily energy/mood/stress logging for context-aware recommendations
- Milestone tracking and achievements

## Tech Stack

**Backend:** Java Spring Boot, SQLite, RESTful API  
**Frontend:** React Native + Expo, NativeWind (Tailwind utilities)  
**AI:** OpenAI API for BRIX intelligence  
**Architecture:** Three-tier (Controller → Service → Repository)

## Design Philosophy

Industrial warmth aesthetic—dark zinc foundation colors representing structural stability, contrasted with orange/amber gradients symbolizing motivational fire. Every visual element reinforces the construction metaphor.

## Success Metrics

- **60% adherence** (3+ workouts/week after 90 days) vs. 10-15% industry average
- **50% retention** (active after 30 days) vs. 15-20% industry average
- **70% comeback rate** (returning after breaks) vs. 20-30% industry average

## Why It Matters

Unlike generic fitness apps that compete on content, B3 competes on **behavioral transformation**. BRIX forms relationships, not just recommendations. The brick metaphor creates tangible progress that abstract numbers cannot match. Users stay because they're building something visible.

## Development Timeline (6 Weeks)

- **Week 1-2:** Core infrastructure (Spring Boot API, database schema, CRUD operations)
- **Week 3-4:** BRIX intelligence layer (behavior tracking, rule engine, OpenAI integration)
- **Week 5:** React Native UI (home, workouts, progress, daily log)
- **Week 6:** Polish, testing, demo preparation, presentation materials

**Tagline:** "Build Yourself. Brick by Brick."

**Core Message:** Fitness isn't about perfection. It's about showing up, laying one brick at a time, and building a foundation strong enough to support the life you want.
